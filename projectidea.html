                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    Our project idea is a workout planning application that provides exercise tasks on a daily basis. The workouts being recommended can range from easy to hard and from short to long. The user will also be able to choose which part of the body they would like to focus on, for example: full body, lower body, chest etc. Hence, the user will be able to choose workout types that suit them best. The application will also contain a streak metre to help users to maintain the routine that they will develop while using this application. A BMI calculator will also be provided for easy and quick access when the users need it. There is also an achievements status that users will be able to use see their progress. This app main target audience of the application will be at home users who are just starting to work out as most of the workouts on the application will be simple and require zero equipment. The main goal of our application will be to help maintain motivation for beginners who want to start working out but aren’t quite sure where to begin. We will help keep users motivated by giving them goals to achieve in the form of the achievements. The achievement system aims to give the user purpose to keep coming back to our workout application and will also be used to track the user’s progress as previously mentioned.

                    <h3>Motivation</h3>
                    Our motivation for this project was that we want to do some light exercises to stay healthy, most of our team was able to keep the routine consistently for a short time, but recently we stopped and couldn’t find a way to get back to our previous routine. We had no motivation to keep up with exercising especially with university assignments and work taking up most of our time and attention, throughout this year. Another reason why this application is important to us is that it is because recent statistics estimate that over 39% of adults around the world were obese and nearly 2.8 million people die from this obesity each year. In recent years, it was also found that 39 million children under the age of 5 are diagnosed with some form of overweight or obesity issues. If our workout application is successful and maintains its purpose to motivate individuals to exercise, then it will teach people how to start look after their health and hopefully lower the number of obese adults in our society and help shape a healthier future and eventually lower the tremendous amount of deaths caused by obesity.

                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    This project is to create an application with the main purpose being that it can motivate and get newer users to start exercising and help them become healthier. Although people who have been working out for a long time can also use this app, generally the application is targeted towards beginners and individuals who are trying to work out for the first time as the workouts will be basic and can be done at home without requiring specific gym equipment. If a person who is experienced and visits the gym regularly were to use our application, it would be considered overkill as the application does not take their experience into consideration. The application will have a checklist that will be contain random workouts that change daily according to which part of the body the user wants to work on, the difficulty level they have picked and whether they want a short or a long workout. The workout exercises can have difficulty levels that range from easy to a bit challenging, this is so that newer users can start working out without being scared or overwhelmed by the workout, this will also encourage them to push themselves and keep challenging themselves to work harder as the workouts will gradually get harder and harder. 
  
                    Unlike other apps that are on the market, the exercises will be generated randomly each day so that users can do different workouts and not get bored sticking to 1 work out and repeating it every day. After finishing a task, the user can click on it to check it off the list and continue to the next one, each day the application will provide 7-8 different exercises that users can do and based on the difficulty there can be more or a smaller number of workouts. The app also has a feature that will keep track of how many consecutive days the user has exercised; this will be shown as the streak counter. By having a streak counter, this allows the app to motivate the users more because it encourages them to keep coming back to achieve a higher streak and seeing that they are maintaining their streak well each day, will also give the user's the satisfaction to keep them pleased with their progress. By hitting a certain amount of streak, the user will unlock different achievements such as working out for 7 days in a row or a month in a row. The app also comes included with a BMI calculator for convenience of the user so the users can check their own statistics anytime and anywhere to know if their exercises have had yielded any improvements or not. With the BMI calculator included, users no longer need to download a separate application or go on websites to track their progress, not only does this help save users’ time, but it also allows them to constantly see their progress so that they are reminded that they have a goal and pushes them to workout harder and more frequently. Furthermore, the aspect that would made this application unique and different from any other workout apps on the market would be the achievement feature, the achievement feature has fixed goals that users must achieve, such as doing exercises continuously for 7 days or doing 1000 push ups in total. In order to push users harder, little achievements like these allows users to have smaller goals that are more achievable, and they can see that they are in fact making progresses and not wasting time.

                   <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
                   After discussing with everyone in the group we decided to switch over to python. Python will be the main programming language that we will be using to code and program this application. This is because most of our team members are most comfortable, using python as they have the most experience in that application. We will be using a python web-framework called Flask, as it is light-weight and is fairly beginner friendly. This is an important feature for our group as some of us had little to no experience, working on and coding and backend of an application. Hence, Flask’s easy to use and easy to understand syntax and concepts will help make our development stage last shorter and help us achieve the final product more efficiently. Along with, Flask, we will also be utilising PostgreSQL, for all our data needs. A database is needed to store user information and their progress but also to store the names of workouts and classify them into difficulties and to express what part of the body is most likely to benefit from a workout. Furthermore, as Flask is a web-framework, we will also need to make use of HTML/CSS to build our frontend on the application. To help us reach the result faster we will also be using Bootstrap, which is CSS framework. Bootstrap will help us achieve the structure that we envision is a more efficient way and will be very useful throughout the whole development stage. After our development stage have been finished, we also be hosting our application or Heroku, which our group have decided would be the best option, as python, PostgreSQL and Heroku as a Tech Stack is really popular and work well with each other.

                   <h3>Skills required</h3>
                   Since we have decided to switch over to use python, the necessary skill that we need is to be able to code in python. Our group would be able to code the application more easily as majority of the group members are familiar and have some experience with python. We have also decided to use Flask, but our group isn’t not experienced with working with Flask so it may take some time for our group to learn and develop the necessary skills for this web-framework. We will also be using a database called PostgreSQL to store our data such as user information or workouts. Most of our group members have experienced SQL before so they are capable of writing SQL themselves and understand the theory behind a database. Furthermore, as this is a group project, we will also need some soft skills, like communicating effectively with our group, especially, about progress to ensure everything runs smoothly and efficiently. We also need effective planning skills, to help manage our time well to ensure that we meet all our deadlines.

                    <h3>Outcome</h3>
                    If the project is successful, the outcome would be an application that motivates its users to work out and exercise. The problem of not being familiar with Flutter and Dart are solved by switching over to a programming language that our group is most familiar with which is python. This allows us to code more comfortably as members in the group have some experience coding with python. We will also be using PostgreSQL and Flask which our group also have some knowledge in, so our project is more feasible that before. The impact of this development is that it will create a user-friendly app and easy to use app that anyone can use, with features that can drive users to develop a healthy routine of exercising and developing a healthier lifestyle.
