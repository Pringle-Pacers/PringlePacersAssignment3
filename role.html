                <p> We have split our team up into roles depending on each person's capabilities and what they are comfortable with doing. As Harsh and Yonathan have a lot of experience in python development more than the others we have decided to assign them with the development of our product the workout tracker, they also have secondary roles such as Scrum master for Yonathan as he is the one ensuring our project is continuing on track and Backend developer to Harsh who is the most confident with Python and flask. We have then assigned Kandy (Cheuk) and Sean (Sheng) frontend / website designer, as they are confident with css html and can help create the report website (refurbish it for this assignment) and create the frontend for the product.
                Daniel and Armand were assigned as Scribes / Report Managers as they have the least experience in either of the other roles and are confident in their writing skills and their proofreading. They will be the ones putting all the information on the report website and making sure our report is up to standard </p>
