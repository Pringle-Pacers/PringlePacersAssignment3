                <h3>What does it do?</h3>
                    Autonomous cars are often known as the future of transport. 
                    But how far is the future that we have all been promised from 
                    companies like Tesla and Waymo. Let’s start by defining what 
                    an autonomous car is. According to the Society of Automotive 
                    Engineers, autonomy can be defined into 6 classifications. 
                    Level 0 is when all car operations are under human driver 
                    control. Example of cars in this category can include older 
                    models of cars that depend completely rely on the driver to 
                    drive the car. Level 1 introduces basic autonomous features is 
                    the form of Automatic Emergency Braking and cruise control. Most 
                    modern cars that are coming out recently can be classified in this 
                    category. Level 2 is when basic self-driving features come in, 
                    for example self-acceleration and steering that may assist the 
                    driver, however the driver must still be active and be in control. 
                    The current version of Tesla’s on the street right now are classified 
                    under this category. Level 3 is when the car can perform most aspects 
                    of driving under specific conditions, but the driver is still expected 
                    to take over when alerted. Companies that have been able to achieve this 
                    level of autonomy is Mercedes-Benz and Honda. Level 4 is when the car is 
                    fully autonomous under certain conditions and requires no human driver 
                    intervention. The cars under this category haven’t been rolled out into 
                    our roads yet, however, there have been prototypes of cars with level 4 
                    autonomy by companies like BMW and Waymo. Finally, Level 5 is when the 
                    car self-drive in every condition without any driver intervention. There 
                    are currently no cars or even prototypes of level 5 autonomy. Level 5 
                    autonomy is what people believe the future of autonomous cars will be. 
                    However, for the time being the highest level of autonomy available to 
                    the general public is level 3. With Mercedes Benz winning world’s first 
                    approval for level 3 autonomous cars in Germany. However, with companies like Waymo 
                    who are pushing the boundaries of Autonomous vehicles, it doesn’t feel like fully 
                    self-driving vehicles described in level 4 and 5 are that far off. Through insights, 
                    by Waymo we also know how such technology is possible in our modern world. Waymo has 
                    described that to reach the last level of autonomy, cars are required to be fitted 
                    with advanced suite of lidar and GPS sensors that records complex data about its 
                    surroundings. That data is then fed to a machine learning algorithm. Through this 
                    process, Waymo can detect and react accordingly to pedestrians, cyclists, vehicles, 
                    construction and even signs and signals, like traffic colours and stop signs. Waymo 
                    has also built up their machine learning algorithm based on over 20 billion simulations, 
                    to predict what other road users might do. It understands that a car behaves differently 
                    than a cyclist or a pedestrian and then predicts the many possible paths that the other 
                    road users may take, all in a spit second. Waymo are so confident about their concept 
                    that they have deemed that Waymo autonomous driver is the “World’s Most Experienced Driver”. 
                    Waymo is pushing the boundaries of what autonomous cars are capable of every-day and are 
                    current closest to rolling-out the 4th level of autonomy with their Waymo Driver Service 
                    better known as a self-driving taxi. With companies like Waymo being on the fourth front 
                    of self-driving cars it will be interesting, seeing what the future of autonomous cars will bring.

                <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
                    As travel is a huge industry that affects billions around the world, the development of autonomous cars is likely to change the world in an immense manner. As a result of these 
                    changes, autonomous vehicles are likely to improve safety on our roads as 94% of accidents on the road are caused by human errors. Furthermore, it is also likely to remove congestions on the road, as autonomous vehicles can move predictably and in a more co-ordinated manner. Advancements in autonomous cars are also likely to increase accessibility for the elderly and disabled individuals as they no longer must operate the vehicle. Not having to operate or drive the vehicle also increases the convenience and reliability factor for most cars. However, with companies like Waymo, closing the distance to self-driving taxis, the advancement to autonomous travel will likely lead to ride-sharing services like Uber, Didi and even normal cabs relying more on self-driving alternatives rather than actual human drivers. As a result of this Uber, Didi and cab drivers are likely to be out of jobs and will have to resort to other means to have a consistent revenue. Moreover, as autonomous vehicles become more and more advanced and transfer over to trucks and buses, it is only a matter of time that all jobs involve driving such vehicles will soon start to fade away. That isn’t all though as self-driving cars will be completely controlled by hardware and software, it likely they are likely to be vulnerable to malicious attacks and can cause cars worldwide to crash purposefully. Lastly, it is also going to affect the auto industry is a major way, as people will rely more on self-driving taxi services, that owning a private car will decline exponentially. After all, why own an expensive vehicle that’s prone to breaking down when you can call a self-driving car on request in seconds. In Conclusion, the rollout of autonomous vehicles will leave an irreversible mark on the world, that will both change the world for the better and yet leave some people jobless.

                <h3>How will this affect you? </h3>
                    When the 4th level of autonomous cars becomes the norm, it will have a drastic impact in the daily routine of a wide range of people. Nowadays, when you need to get from point A point B with the help of a car, a driver needs to be behind the wheel operating the car and navigating the streets themselves. However, due to human errors things can go south and accidents can occur. According to budget direct, 64% of Australians have been in at least one car accident. One of the most, common causes of these accidents include, speeding, distracted or fatigued driving and drink driving. The invention of level 4 autonomy will however lower those statistics heavily as self-driving cars have experience built up from over 20 billion simulations to handle almost incidents and dilemma. Hence, soon people will be less likely to suffer from fatalities on the road. Perhaps the most important change that autonomous cars will bring is that it will render driving licence’s redundant as eventually self-driving cars will be like getting into a taxi. This means, individuals in the future won’t have to go through the strict tests and put in hours of driving on the road to attain a driver’s licence. This will make cars more accessible for the general public, especially for teenagers who previously had to wait until 16 years of age to take a learners knowledge test. Not having a human driver behind the wheel, also means that cars will be more accessible, to individuals who suffer from a movement disability or couldn’t normally drive a car because of other reasons, as the cars require little to no input from a human driver.
