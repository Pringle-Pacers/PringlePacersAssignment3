                <h3>What does it do?</h3>
                    Machine learning is a process in which AI (Artificial Intelligence) is able to use algorithms and previously input data to predict future data. Machine learning is achieved without being specifically programmed to do so, but rather uses data to make interpretations and connections to find possible future data (1). Machine learning is important as it allows us to make find trends and predictions in data in order to improve development. Machine learning has helped to improve AI technology to develop society as it can be used for multiple things such as medical diagnosis, image recognition, marketing trends etc. (2). In its current state, machine learning has drastically improved over the years. When machine learning was first introduced, the amount of people using it was relatively low and so few people knew its capabilities but over time, machine learning was beginning to be used by industries and businesses, thus increasing the awareness of it. It was reported a study that in 2020, 49% of organizations were interested in implementing machine learning for their use (3). Another survey has shown that in 2020 67% of companies were actively using machine learning. The interest and use of machine learning has grown considerably and will continue to do so as it has become a core feature for the development of company and organizations alike. As interest increases, so does the development of machine learning. Every year, the algorithm of machine learning is improved, with it either being built upon or replaced with more efficient and advanced algorithm (4). There are many things that machine learning can do, some of which was already previously mentioned before but currently machine learning has not reached its full capabilities. In the present day alongside medical diagnosis, image recognition and marketing trends, machine learning is able to improve semantic segmentation, detection and classification, natural language processing, language modelling and speech recognition (5). More developments could be introduced but the problem is due to the fact that machine learning is hindered by the technology that allows it to function. Machine learning also relies heavily on data it’s been given and its ability to process them. In order for more improvement, the capabilities of computing power, RAM, processors, and algorithms needs to be improved. Although just like the rapid development of machine learning, technological advancement is also developing at a fast rate. In the future, we could see the use of quantum computers being used in machine learning (6). Quantum computing allows for such fast-processing speeds that far outmatch the speeds of modern-day processors. If they were to be implanted then machine learning could process so much more data, increasing its ability to analyse, predict and detect. They can be used more reliably for medical purposes such as detecting diseases, symptoms, pain, new diseases etc which could allow for the health and life expectancy of society to increase (6). They can also be used to improve autonomous vehicles as machine learning will be able to improve its ability to detect roads, object, people, and its ability to navigate and calculate the fastest route (6). These are just some examples of the future impact of machine learning and there is many more still waiting to be discovered but the future development of machine learning will help improve the society.

                <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
                The Potential impact of Machine Learning is the ability to assist with development of Autonomous vehicles by allowing A.I to make unprogrammed decisions depending on the observed situation, allowing the vehicles to operate more safely (7). It will also allow to assist with research and development of medicine, it will allow machines to analyse data at speeds humans cannot and suggest diagnoses or treatments that may be overlooked by the physician (7). The things that are likely to change are the level at which automated programs and machines to help humans do functions they already do but in an easier fashion. It could help remove menial jobs that are tedious and sometimes inhumane and allow them to be done by automated machines. There is a variety of change depending on the person. People working in factories may lose their jobs as they are needed less and less, and machines get used increasingly which will start automating the manufacturing process. People that use automated products such as autonomous vehicles, the internet (and its ads) will get to see a smarter system as autonomous vehicles become safer to use and the internet and its search engine become better and more sophisticated and start showing more precise results. This will improve current technology that already exists whilst removing jobs that are more manual yet tedious or inhumane.                 </div>

                <h3>How will this affect you? </h3>
                I believe that these developments will definitely have an impact on my life and everyone else’s, but I believe that it will mostly have a positive impact. Being able to see new developments in the medical field could bring new ways to keep myself and others safe and healthy, decreasing the risk of getting sick. Also being able to rely on autonomous cars will help with me get to places without the need to have a driver's licence or to take public transport which will help me, and others get to where they need to be on time. Although there are many positives, the one thing that I worry about is being able to find a job. With machine learning being able to do what people can do, sometimes even better, I worry about the possibility that unemployment rates will go up. Either way, there are positives and negatives with machine learning, but I believe it will change the lives of people for the better.                 </div>
