              Hi, my name is Yonathan Kogan, student number s3719826 and am a member of the Pringle Pacers team. I was born in Israel and have Russian parents; I have been living in Australia for the last 12 years.

            <h3> Profile </h3>
              As an Adventurer, these tests let me know that I have the personality that works hard and strives to improve myself, it also tells me that I like to experiment with new things to improve myself and change the way I am. Although these personality tests may tell me who I am or how I interact with life, I think that everything depends on the scenario and my behavior would depend on the team and their personalities. When forming a team, personality doesn’t matter too much, as long as they are cooperative as a team and work hard the rest of your personality shouldn’t matter, you can be whatever you want as long as you do your job. </p>

              According to the 3 test results, which shows that I am a visual learner. I feel confident to do that task about pictures, design and drawing. I could help Pringle Pacers to achieve those visual parts, such as UX/UI design, framework. Also I am a flexible person and I am not a judger. I never stubun. I feel free to listen to different opinions and change. I rarely argue with my teammates. I would find a way to balance both opinions. Which could make the group always stay calm and think properly. Sometimes I will follow my feeling rather than thinking, which means I could come up with many ideas for my team. Because some people may think too much or too care about the rule, causing them difficulty to come up with innovative ideas.

              The results of my personality test have determined that I am an ENFJ-A which is a protagonist type moral leader, while the learning style test determines that while I can draw from audio, visual and tactile learning, I gain the most from visual learning and personality trait scores determine I have the most within openness and extraversion of the 5 personality traits. This information obtained can determine that I should try to guide the group morally and use graphical depictions to better understand new content. I should also try to leverage the personality trait of openness and extraversion to help gather opinions or criticisms from another or towards myself, to better the group by providing ideas that will help advance our project or to provide solutions to the problems of it.

            <h3> Profile </h3>
              As an architect, Sean is a perfectionist meaning he aims to improve himself while also keeping his work at his best so that he can meet his own standards. Being a reflector, Sean is overly cautious making him more prone to notice trivial details that the team may miss which can contribute to the quality of the work. Sean is also a transformative leader, making him hungry for knowledge, this allows him to constantly look for ways to improve so that the quality of his work can be better. The team would benefit from Sean’s high standards of himself which can leads to a better quality of work for his team.

          <h3> Similarities and Differences </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Looking at the trends of ideal jobs, it seems that Software Engineering is the most desired job title, followed by Data Scientist in the near second (Data Analyst doing pretty much the same as a Data Scientist). </li>
            <li>The main difference between a Software engineer and a Data Scientist is the Software Engineer will build around the data to produce a final product, whereas a data scientist will use the data to redisplay to show it as the final product. </li>
            <li>As a Data Scientist, you are likely to utilize languages like Python, as libraries like Pandas make a popular option among many Data Scientists. Whereas as the most used language for Software Engineers is JavaScript as, it allows developers to write front-end code and back-end code, through libraries like React.JS and Node.JS. </li>
            <li>The main technical similarity between a software Engineer and Data Scientist is that they both must make use of SQL, which is a database query language, to retrieve and write data to a database. </li>
