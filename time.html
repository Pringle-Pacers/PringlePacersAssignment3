              <h2> Plans for future development</h2>
              If the timeframe of our project were increased to allow for further development, we would proceed and include new features and overall general improvements in functionality. We would spend the next few weeks to implement new features such as a âchat with a trainerâ feature and a âbook a gym featureâ. These features are something we would have liked to include in our original timeframe but due to the time constraints, we decided to hold off on it. Adding these features would increase user satisfaction and their needs, further progressing towards our goal for individuals to access beginner friendly workouts and exercise. We would then proceed to making sure that the app is free of any errors and its functionality is not hindered in any way. Over a few weeks, our team will focus on bug fixing to ensure that app is functional for the user to use.
              <br>
              <br>
              <p><b>Week 5<br></b>
                In this week. We aim to continue the development of the achievement list. Its finalization of development wasnât fully completed in week 4 as the progress bar and the achievements of certain workouts were not implemented so it will be completed during this week.
              <p><b>Week 6<br></b>
                In this week, we aim to discuss and plan the addition of a new feature to our web application. This feature will be a chat feature that will allow users to talk with a trainer about workouts. We will brainstorm ideas on how this feature would be designed and implanted into the web application.
              <p><b>Week 7<br></b>
                In this week, we aim to create a low and high-fidelity prototype of the feature. The low fidelity prototype will include the featureâs UI (User Interface) design and layout such as choosing where buttons will be placed, where the chat box will be placed, size of fonts, font colours, picture placement etc. LucidChart will be used to create the low-fidelity prototype. The high-fidelity prototype will be a highly detailed and improved version of the low fidelity prototype where the functions for things such as buttons will be mapped. Figma will be used to design the high-fidelity prototype.
              <p><b>Week 8<br></b>
                In this week, we plan to do the programming and the testing for the chat feature. Just like the previous implemented features, python will be used to program the functions and will be continuedly tested until it is working. We will also be creating the html and CSS for the function.
              <p><b>Week 9<br></b>
                This week will be dedicated to fixing any bugs or errors. With the implementation of a new feature and app being functional for a few weeks, we plan to make sure that the web application is functioning as required in order to maintain the satisfaction of the user.
              <p><b>Week 10<br></b>
                This week will involve planning the addition of another feature which is the admin page. A brainstorm of its features and functionality will be discussed with the group before proceeding to develop a prototype.
              <p><b>Week 11<br></b>
                In this week, we will work on developing the low and high-fidelity prototypes of admin page. The low fidelity will focus on its UI design, deciding what the achievements are and where its layout will be. The high-fidelity prototype will make improvements from the low-fidelity prototype and will be including mapped out functions of the feature. LucidChart and Figma will be used to design both prototypes
              <p><b>Week 12<br></b>
                This week will be dedicated the development of the admin page programming, html and CSS. Python will be used to program the features functionalities and the html and CSS will be programmed to create the design of the project.
              <p><b>Week 13<br></b>
                This week will be dedicated the development of theÂ admin page programming, html and CSS. Python will be used to program the featuresÂ functionalities and the html and CSS will be programmed to create the design of the project.
              <p><b>Week 14<br></b>
                This week will focus on bug fixes to ensure the web application is functional without any errors or bugs.
              <p><b>Week 15<br></b>
                This week will involve having an investor meeting to discuss if the app has met their requirements. This discussion will let us know if change need to be made or any features should also be included.
