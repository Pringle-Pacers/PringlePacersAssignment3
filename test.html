                <h3>Overview</h3>
                    The project will be tested be via user acceptance testing which will accomplished by providing a prototype of the application towards end users, as this will be the most time efficient and cost-effective method to determine if we have accomplished the scope of the application as well as to iron out and errors, or to alter the program and add more features. The first stage of the UAT testing is gathering the appropriate users, which will be done anonymously to prevent information bias which prevents an accurate representation of feedback among the participants. The second stage involves gathering the relevant feedback from the users. The specific issues we may be looking for are validation and functional problems with the program, and potential improvement to the ergonomics of the application. We will have succeeded in testing, when we have gathered data from the individual participants that is valuable enough to be synthesised into information that will provide an accurate perspective on the positive and negative aspects of the application and whether the application has performed as what the user has expected, and to what we as the developers have intended. This is acceptable once the feedback of the participants has been reciprocated such as having pushed a feature such as achievements to a greater significance if it is popular or high demand among the participants.
