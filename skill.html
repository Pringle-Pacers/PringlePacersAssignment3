                In order for the project to develop successfully, the team would need a senior software engineer, a data scientist, a marketing coordinator, and a UX designer. The senior software engineer would be responsible for the programming and coding part of the whole project and ensuring that the website works as intended, the data scientist would be analysing the data and if there is a problem regarding the whole project, they should also be making the correct decision to solve the problem. The marketing coordinator is needed so that the project is able to gain more users, and lastly a UX designer would be responsible for the interface of the website and if users do not like the way the website looks and functions then the UX designer should come up with a solution so that the website can satisfy users.

                To help us reach our desired final product, we would need to hire a data scientist and a UX designer. A data scientist is required in-case we encounter a hard decision. A data scientist will be able to use data and interpret the said data to help us understand the problem that requires us to make a decision. As a result of this, the decision we make will be more informed as we are intending to take a more data driven approach in our organisation. Furthermore, as one of our ultimate aims is to make a beginner friendly application, a UX designer will be necessary to help understand our user base in more details and will help us determine how we can optimise our user interface to better cater to our user base.

                <h3>Cheuk Lam Chung </h3>
                The team required soft skills, such as communication skill, teamwork, time management and innovative thinking. Communication skill is necessary in the team to understand the team membersâ€™ situation, which helps to build trust and respect. It is also effective to help share creative ideas and have problem solving in the team. Teamwork is to achieve the same goal together in the same team by using each other to progress. Without teamwork, it would be difficult for the team to solve problems and process the project. Time management is also required in the team, managing the task before the deadline is necessary. The team may not meet the deadlines without time management. Also, teams need someone to have innovative thinking. To be successful and outstanding, innovation is needed.

                <h3>Armand Lopez</h3>
                    The hard skills that the team would require regarding a software engineer, a data scientist, a marketing coordinator and a UX designer is programming, statistical analysis, project management and wireframing/UI prototyping, just to highlight an important few. These skills are essential to those specific jobs as the project relies heavily on those skills for it to be fully functional and to help the project be further improved, otherwise the project will remain at a standard that will not satisfy the users and the designers alike and improvements will never be made.

                <h3>Daniel Tran</h3>
                    Of the general skills required such as communication, teamwork, time management and innovation, time management was a requirement to ensure deadlines were met and that the project had been flowing properly, as to not cause delays. It also helped create a better idea on how much effort was allocated to each task via the amount of time associated with each of them. Another general skill that was integral to the success of the project was innovation which was used to propel the project forward by providing solutions to existing problems or creating new methods or designs to improve the project.
