                   Having looked at the Burning Glass Data and comparing it to today's job market it seems 
                    that the Data is actually pretty similar to today's needs. This means that although being 
                    a Software engineer is not at the top of the list, because of the way the market is right 
                    now and the way that applications incorporate many parts of programming it is still a broad 
                    role which I would like to pursue and continue to work toward.

                     not ranked as high as I thought it would be in terms of job demand. However, the Skills
                     required to facilitate the job of Software Engineer is definitely something I want to 
                     learn more about in the future and am still keen to step into the industry of Software Engineering.
                     I enjoy programming and as seen by Burning Glass Data, Software Engineering relies heavily on 
                     programming, Hence Software Engineering is still my dream job.

                     a software engineer is placed in the middle which is where I somewhat expected 
                     it to be. Although I had hoped it would be somewhat higher up, it doesn’t change
                     my choice about wanting to become a software engineer as I have always been 
                     fascinated with programming and how that can be used to make software. Even 
                     if it was a less popular occupation, I would still pursue it as it is something I 
                     think I would enjoy.

                     My ideal job was game developer, but after I read through the Burning Glass data I changed my ideal 
                     job to software engineer. In Burning Glass, I found out how software engineers are needed nowadays. 
                     Burning Glass Technologies' report “Software is Everywhere” shows that the demand for software developers 
                     in the rest of the country grows 3x faster. That is why I want to get into a software engineer job 
                     in the future. Also, the salary of software engineers is generally high. However, highest salaries 
                     also tended to have the highest demand. Software engineer is not an easy job. Therefore, I have to 
                     gain my IT and general skills before getting into this job.

                     <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                     Having seen the Burning Glass data, my opinion has not changed, because while Data Analytics is not even 
                     within the highest selected Job titles shown by the Burning Data bar graph, it shares many qualities that are in 
                     high demand by employers. These general skills are problem-solving, communication skills and organisational skills,
                     while for IT skills it is Business Management and SQL. These skills that are in common between the top demanded skills 
                     and the skills required for a Data Analyst demonstrate that because these share many similarities, Data Analysts are both 
                     highly applicable and in favourably in demand. Hence, because of the likelihood of finding a position as a Data Analyst, 
                     I do not see a reason to reconsider my ideal job.

                     <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                     My ideal job was data scientist, which was not on Burning Glass, but looking at the data on Burning Glass, 
                     I found that system engineering was the top 4 job title which I thought would be lower on the list. After 
                     some research, I found that system engineer does not require lots of coding as they are there to ensure that 
                     all work and progress goes smoothly. With the limited experience that I have with coding, I found that this 
                     job is better suited for me as data scientists requires more coding skills.
