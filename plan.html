                <h3>Intro</h3>
                To reach the final product of a working application, that the user can interact with to start working out daily, we have gone through various stages of development and artefact development. The very first and perhaps the most vital part of the setup process was our Trello board. As we are working in a team of 6 members, Trello was essential to track everybody's progress and ensure that everyone is on par with each other and working in unison. Trello along with regular teams' meetings has helped us to fast forward through the planning and setup stage and focus mainly on the development and documentation of our application. Our development stage has consisted of both low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes which have certainly assisted us when we reached the Python Flask and Database stage. The prototypes have helped us define how many pages are expected and helped determine the scale of the project. Similarly, Prototypes have also helped us define the data requirements for our project, and helped us determine what our Database schema would look like. All and all our end goal, for our workout application, is to have a working prototype hosted on Heroku, which is the cloud hosting platform we have chosen due to its ability to work well with Python and PostgreSQL

                <h3>Low</h3>
                In this stage of the project, a low-level mock-up of the project will be created to design the app’s interface. Creating a low fidelity prototype will allow us to brainstorm and make constant changes to the design of the app which gives us an indication of how we would like to proceed when creating a high-fidelity prototype and the artefact. As such, we decided to use a website called LucidChart which provided the necessary tools to create a low fidelity prototype. In our low fidelity prototype, we designed 11 different key pages that would be needed in the artefact. This includes the login page, signup page, home page, about us page, workout selection page, workout list randomizer page, my list page, achievement page, BMI calculator, page profile page and profile edit page. We were able to design the layout of the buttons, menus, lists etc on each page and as well as the overall colour scheme for the whole app. We were able to complete a full low fidelity prototype of our work out app in under a week, and plan to use it to create an improved and high-standard interface in our high-fidelity prototype

                <h3>High </h3>
                During this stage of the project, a high-fidelity prototype based on the modification of the low fidelity will be made to give us a better view of how the website will look like as a whole with the usage of Figma. We began by taking the basic mock-up we did during the low fidelity stage and changed some aspects of it to fit our group’s satisfactions such as the colour scheme of the website. The group then assigned each person a page or two to work on while staying consistent with the theme that the group had chosen. So far, the group had finished the majority of the prototype with some minor modifications still needed to be done, which are mainly just the navigation bar. We still haven’t mapped out each button on the page so that it shows what each button does and how the users are expected to use the website. By the end of the submission, we should be able to complete the flow and fix up minor issues of the high-fidelity prototype. Being able to finish this mock-up means that it would be easier for our group to code the website as we will have a clear understanding of the function each button and website would achieve. If our group decides to make changes to the mock-up in the future it would be when we want to add more functionality to our website, which we then need to decide on how it would look like so that we can finalise the decision and implement it later.

                <h3>Heroku</h3>
                When we created this team and discussed our project idea we found that although people had experience in programming the experience varied majorly across the board going from brand new first years to 4th years finishing their university which meant that we had a variety of languages but not everyone knew them as such we selected a comfortable pick for most people, we had 3/6 group members confident in Python and 1 having dabbled in it but no major work in it, as such our project was decided to be coded in Python. Whilst deciding on how to host our website we have had multiple recommendations from team members and people who have used python previously and we were told that one of the better free hosting websites is Heroku. Heroku allows for free hosting of your website with github compatibility with the ability for CICD allowing us to update our code and it goes to our live application as we update it. This will allow for easier testing and the ability to have external users test our application as required, although this will not be used as much until a nicer product was created this allows for more successful testing towards the end. This caused us to also decide on the database we would use, unfortunately with Heroku, using SQLite which many of us had used before was impossible as it breaks the database. As such we must use postgres which we had 2 of us use before. Although this was a slight hurdle to overcome it was a slight change to the way we connect to the database, but the SQL language was effectively the same.

                <h3>User</h3>
                In the user testing stage, which is also the last stage of our project, we will let our end- user test our application. We separate 3 stages in user testing. First stage, we will identify our end-user by some attribute, such as age, gender, whether he/she frequently workout or not. Second stage is to let those end-users try our application in Figma and the working prototype developed in Python Flask. Figma is a tool for us to create high fidelity prototypes. Tester will test the application by using the user interface we created in Figma or from the Python Flask prototype. The purpose is to test if our application is user friendly or not. Last stage is to modify the application if necessary to update.

                <b>Unit testing</b>
                <br>
                Our team planned to use unit testing to test the functionality of the application. Such as sign in, sign out, edit profile. To test if a user's sign in details is added to the database, and check if the information from the database is able to login by user. To test the edit profile function is to check if it is able to edit data from the database. We also have further functions in the workout application to test, depending on what function to provide appropriate tests to the feature of the application.

                <b>Acceptance testing</b>
                <br>
                Acceptance testing is basically  for user interface. Our team planned to list all the acceptance requirements for every page and functions. Such as my list page, workout selection page, randomise workout page. All it will do is to show the steps of how the single feature functions. After the implementation is done, we do the acceptance test by following the requirement. The purpose of using acceptance testing is to determine whether the application satisfies the requirements.
