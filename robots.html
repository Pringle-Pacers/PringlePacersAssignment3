                <h3>What does it do?</h3>
                    Robots are reprogrammable, multifunctional manipulators designed to move material, parts, tools or specialized devices through a variable programmed motion for a variety of tasks. Back in the day, robots were mostly categorised as Traditional Industrial Robots, this means that they tend to do repetitive work with little to no interaction with humans and are not intelligent. At the current state, robotics is not at its final stage yet, we are only still at the very beginning of the development of robots, there are still many things that we have yet to fully developed and explored, and the field of robots is rapidly changing constantly transforming and evolving. As of right now, most of the robots that we can observe in our daily lives are often being used to perform tasks that are simple and repetitive, robots are also made so that they are able to perform tasks that may be considered to be dangerous for a person to do. But that these robots that perform simple tasks are created in order to improve our daily lives and allow us to do tasks in a more convenient way. Some of these can be seen in restaurants where robots are used to cook and serve customers, this assists chefs by performing tasks that are programmed in them. Not only do these robots lower the workloads for workers, but they also ensure that all products are made consistently and efficiently. In the past 10 years, we have created many robots that are unique and serve different purposes. Curiosity, the rover that has been operating for 9 years on Mars since 2012. This particular robot allowed humans to learn more about the planet Mars and its habitability for humans, this study may lead us to find a potentially suitable planet that we can expand an inhabit people on it. In the next few years, robots are very likely to take over work positions that we currently have, this is due to the fact that robots are able to performs task repetitively while also keeping mistake made to the lowest possible, jobs that are heavily dependent on labours may no longer be required as they are highly likely to be replaced by robots. This may help businesses save money as they do not have to worry about defects made on their products, they can also save a large sum of money as they no longer need to pay for their employees and no needing to fear that robots would stop working. After that, robots may also be further developed in order to converse and have a thought process like us human, currently there is very few robots that are able to do so, such as Sofia the robot that was able to converse with human while thinking on itself. These types of robots are able to be develop is due to artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence has also been on the rise lately, with this innovative technology, many manufacturers are testing and learning AI so that it can be implemented into their future products. Artificial intelligence is behaviour by machines that, if performed by a human being, would be considered intelligent. This recent technology may enable the robot industry to expand further as they will be used to enhance the quality of robots being produced.

                <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
                Robots will make our lives more convenient; this is because most of the things we do right now can and will be done by robots in the future, household chores can be lessened as easy chores such as cleaning our cooking can all be completed by robots. These benefits will improve the quality of our lives and making day to day tasks easier for everyone. But the rise of robots is not always beneficial to humans, as of right now there is already a lot of people who are unemployed due to COVID and with the rises on robots, more and more current jobs positions will be replaced and us human will no longer be required to work. This means that the rate of employment will be increased while jobs availability is lowered, this may create a sense of job insecurity in many people as they do not know when they will be replaced and me dismissed by their employers. The jobs that are most likely to be replaced in the next few years are labourer jobs, as these jobs tends to be repetitive which is best suited for robots to do, such as moving crates or manufacturing. This means that in order to get a job, the process would be harder in the future as a university degree are needed or having to possess certain skills. These certain aspects may pose as restrictions when applying for jobs and the opportunity for finding a job are less likely to occur. This may also affect the economy in the far future when more jobs are replaced by automations. Depending on how it is viewed, economy can be affected positively robots are less likely to make mistake meaning that businesses are able to maximise their productivity, efficiency and cost reduction which will contribute to the GDP of the country. Not only that, but it will also lower the product prices as businesses are able to lower the price because their cost is reduced meaning that everyone can buy for a cheaper price.

                <h3>How will this affect you? </h3>
                If robots are to become common, manufacturers are able to keep a constant stock of products meaning that I would not have to worry about product being out of stock and waiting a long period of time for restock. But by having robots producing product in order to lower the price and maintaining the level of stock, businesses would have to lower their production cost and job opportunity will have to be sacrificed. In the future, I would be less likely to be able to apply for a job position in the future. As robots are starting to replace jobs, there is little to no reason for a business to hire an employee when they can use a robot that make no mistakes while keeping it workflow to the maximum, there would be a big competition between me and other competitors who are trying to apply for the same job making it very difficult to find a job in the near future. Even if I do find a job, it may not be long term, as robots are getting more advance by the day, there will eventually be a robot that has sufficient requirement to replace the position that I might possibly have. This makes it incredibly hard to feel secure about the job position as there is a high chance of being dismissed. Robots are still improving by the day and may affect everyoneâ€™s future both positively and negatively.                 </div>
