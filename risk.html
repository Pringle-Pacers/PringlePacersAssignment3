                <h3>Group member have lack of experience </h3>
                In the project, we are going to use python to create an application website. However, some of the members do not have much experience in coding. Our group may need to take more time to learn or figure out the code. Which will cause the project delay or produce an application with lack of quality.

                <h3>The website may not valuable to the users </h3>
                In our project, we are trying to develop a useful or helpful application for our users. However, do they really need the application? Is it necessarily for users to use the application? Misunderstanding users’ demand is a common error in developing applications (Creative Tim, 2021). Sometimes developers think they are creating an application to help users. In fact, users do not even need the application or think that is redundant, which is a huge loss in development. To prevent the risk, development should ensure what their end-user really needs. Keep the end-user in mind the whole time. Since our project is a Workout Application, we should focus on someone who likes to work out and sport, then ask ourselves what those people really need? And keep that in mind, so that we would not create an invaluable application.

                <div class="tech-content-section">
                <h3>Unsafe Networking </h3>
                In a website application, data is frequently transmitted between the server and the client. Every time the website sends information it is utilising the internet and provider’s network. So that the intruders could take advantage of website security breaches to capture user details through the internet. For us to prevent that, we should encrypt all data and make sure our authentication keys are not easily accessible and test websites through penetration testing, threat modelling, and emulators.

                <div class="tech-content-section">
                <h3>Lack of UX/UI design </h3>
                UX/UI is a role to show the application feature by using an understandable way. In other words, UX/UI is a packaging for the app. “Users tend to interact with apps that seem to be user-friendly and provide a great user experience.” (Creative Tim, 2021). Sometimes, development though they are having a good UX/UI design. However, it has to be tested through the end-user to prove if it is user-friendly or not. To reduce this risk, our team should do some surveys before designing the app and do testing on users to get the feedback.
