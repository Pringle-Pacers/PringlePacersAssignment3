                <h3>What does it do?</h3>
                Cloud is everywhere in our life, which brings us a lot of benefits. What is cloud? Cloud is working via the internet. For example, cloud is able to host and deliver services over the internet. Unlike traditional hosting, cloud hosting makes applications and websites accessible using cloud resources. For example, use a network of connected virtual and physical cloud servers hosting the website or application, the adventager is flexibility and scalability. Cloud services have three main delivery models, which are Software as a Service (SaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS). SaaS is a way of delivering applications over the internet as a service, such as email, Netflix, Microsoft Office, those are common applications in our daily life. Therefore, users no longer need to install and maintain software, they can just simply access it via the internet and be free to manage their software and hardware. IaaS is a system of cloud computing that delivers virtualized computing resources over the internet, which means businesses are able to use IaaS to provide the infrastructure to support web apps, such as storage, web and application services, networking resources. Using IaaS technology is able to increase security, scalability and flexibility. PaaS is a cloud environment in which customers are able to complete development and deployment. In other words, PaaS is a platform or tool for building applications or websites via the internet. For instant, operating system, programming language execution environment. The difference between PaaS and SaaS is that PaaS is the cloud-based platform for building software. SaaS products are fully developed by other companies for users to use via the internet.

                Cloud has changed how we work and how we live today. In the future, likely in 3 years, clouds will still affect our life. According to Insights Success, they predicted that clouds can create online ‘bare metal’ data servers with artificial intelligence. They discovered the emergence of ‘robot’ servers powered by the cloud, where the machine learns to perform tasks based on what they learn. Since cloud-based data and storage services will learn to predict our behaviours and make smart recommendations to allow us to access this data and data storage even when it is not technically online. That is how the cloud enables us to create artificial intelligence on bare metal servers, since bare metal servers work with artificial intelligence it will become super-efficient. Also, large-scale data centre infrastructure will eventually be powered by artificial intelligence, cloud users no longer need to rely on external storage or hosted servers. They can consume virtual machine storage directly from their dedicated hardware. Furthermore, Insights Success also mentions that clouds are already moving towards serverless computing. In the future, we will see serverless computing everywhere. Serverless computing is incredibly fast, uses less CPU power and runs off fewer resources, which brings a lot of benefits. Therefore, many companies are focusing on a serverless-first architecture. If one day the cloud serverless computing fully be done, the cloud will become even more embedded in our daily lives. Through my research, edge computing could make those possible, since edge computing is the evolution of cloud computing and edge computing will eventually overtake and replace cloud computing. Therefore, edge computing is possible to do what cloud computing can do.

                <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
                Cloud computing except enables us to run software programs without installing the application on our computers, which also provides lower computer cost, which means a high-power computer is no longer needed, since applications run in the cloud. A desktop computer does not require processing power or hard disk space demanded by traditional desktop software. Which means we can save a lot of money, we do not need to spend a large amount of the money to get a high quality computer. Especially gamers, some of the games need a high-power to run it. With cloud computing, gamers can just run the game smoothly on a normal computer by using a cloud computer. Also, cloud computing is affecting every company, according to TechnologyAdvice, Turco said that cloud computing provides financial benefits like budget savings. In fact, companies can save an average of 15 percent on all IT costs by migrating to the cloud. In the future, since the cloud created an economic way to use computers and high-power computers are no longer needed. Which means cloud computing will replace most of the computers and make high-power computers redundant. No more computer component sales needed, because they no longer need to sell any expensive PC components to the customers. Therefore, cloud computing makes computer costs lower. With cloud computing, people can save large amounts of money to build a high-power computer. Especially gamers and companies are most affected by cloud computing. Cloud computing will replace some of the computers and make some of the computer components sales redundant.

                <h3>How will this affect you? </h3>
                There are many things that cloud is affecting me in my daily life without realising it, such as social media. I mostly use Instagram to communicate, check in on my favourite celebrities, share funny links, and share my daily life. It is all happening in the cloud because it is a service we use via the internet. Also, every photo or story I post on Instagram will be stored in the cloud, that is why I am still able to access my photo and story when I login to my Instagram account on another device. Another cloud daily life impact is entertainment. Before the cloud, we were only able to watch TV or listen to radio for entertainment. But now cloud delivered Netfile, Youtube to let us watch whatever TV show or video we want, and also Sptifly gives us the freedom to listen to our favourite songs. Without social media and entertainment which means I am not able to see each other’s daily life sharing and not able to watch our favourite movie with my family. Without the cloud my life would not be as diversified as it is now. Also in personal storage we no longer need to buy an expensive and heavy hard disk for saving our personal photos. I am using an iPhone and I bought the iCould to save my 5,000 photos on my phone. Without a cloud I have nowhere to save my large amount of photos. Gamil service is also stored on cloud, so that we can check our email on any device which is quite flexible. In fact, cloud storage has become so pervasive that most people do not realise they use it, including myself. Therefore, the cloud has changed a lot in my daily life, which brings convenience and flexibility to me and my family and friends.                 </div>
