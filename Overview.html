                    <h3>Topic</h3>
                    Our project idea is a workout planning application that provides exercise tasks on a daily basis. The application will be targeted towards beginners looking to exercise at home but don’t know where to begin. The application will assist the users by assigning a random list of curated workouts, the application will also provide a short demonstration to users to teach them how to perform the workout. For practical purposes, we are going to assume that the user is a complete amateur to the world of exercising and provide them with all the information to get started in their journey without being too overwhelming and confusing. Hence, we are also assuming that the user has no workout related equipment, therefore the workouts will have to be carefully designed to have no equipment needed, or only the equipment that you can ordinarily find in a house. As our main audience is complete amateurs to exercising, it is important to note that it may not be suited for individuals who are experienced with exercising or users who go to the gym regularly. In conclusion, the main goal of our application will be to help maintain motivation for beginners who want to start working out but aren’t quite sure where to begin.
                    The workouts being recommended can range from easy to hard and from short to long. The user will also be able to choose which part of the body they would like to focus on, for example: Abs or hamstrings. Hence, the user will be able to choose workout types that suit them best. The application will also contain a streak metre to help users to maintain their routine that they will develop while using this application. A BMI calculator will also be provided for easy and quick access when the users need it. There is also an achievements status that users will be able to use to see their progress. The achievement feature will help keep users motivated by giving them goals to achieve. The achievement system aims to give the user purpose to keep coming back to our workout application and will also be used to track the user’s progress as previously mentioned. If the user is feeling kind of brave, and have finished their allocated workouts already, they will also be allowed to assign more workouts themselves or be able to randomise more the same day with the click of a button. Overall, the features present in our application will help lead our users to a healthier lifestyle, by encouraging them to exercise rather than procrastinating.

                    <h3>Motivation</h3>
                    Our motivation for this project was that we want to do some light exercises to stay healthy. As our team discussed, most of us were able to keep the routine consistently for a short period of time, but recently we hit a roadblock and couldn’t find a way to get back to our previous routine. We found that we had no motivation to keep up with exercising, especially with university assignments and work taking up most of our time and attention, throughout this year. Another reason why this application is important to us is because recent statistics estimate that over 39% of adults around the world were obese and nearly 2.8 million people die from this obesity each year. In recent years, it was also found that 39 million children under the age of 5 are diagnosed with some form of overweight or obesity issues. If we fully completed this project, it would show potential employers that we are able to work efficiently and effectively inside a team, it would also demonstrate to them that we have the technical skills to not only manage a medium-scale project but also to use our technical knowledge to deliver a final product and satisfy the needs of our potential customers that we have aimed to cater our project towards. The project fits the IT trend of cloud computing as it will be hosted in the cloud, allowing for the project to be accessible by a multitude of users and allows for storing and processing data more efficiently.Our project not only fits into the current IT trends but also the general trends as especially in today’s modern era, where people are likely to neglect their health, it will be a great service to lower the number of obese adults in our society and help shape a healthier future and eventually lower the tremendous number of deaths caused by obesity.

                    <h3>Landscape</h3>
                    There are a range of workout applications that exist in the market currently, that aim to assist their users by giving them a curated list of workouts. One of the main competitors in the market currently is “Home Workout”. Home workout is available to download on the Apple App Store and the Android Play Store. Looking at the data from its Play Store page we can see that it has more than 100 million downloads. This means that Home Workout apps are in demand right now, especially as we have been through the lockdown phase, where we were encouraged to isolate and stay at home. Similar to our application, Home Workout also aims to have workouts that require little to no equipment. However, what really sets our app apart from Home Workout is that in Home Workout the user must pick the workouts they want to focus on or choose an already curated list of workouts. Our app takes a different approach, where instead of having a set list of workouts, the workouts are randomised every-day.
                    Furthermore, our app also allows the users to randomise the workouts again or choose workouts themselves, once they have finished their daily randomised list of workouts. We chose to take a different approach from Home Workout, as having random workouts ensures that the users remain encouraged and interested to keep working out as the workouts won’t be repetitive, it will feel like a fresh start every day. Furthermore, Home Workout also doesn’t employ any techniques or features to keep the user returning for more. According to feedback from some of our team who have used the Home Workout in the past, they have reported that they downright lost interest in Home Workout as there was nothing for them to get back to. Our application aims to fix that by having an achievement system that keeps track of how times you have done a particular workout and awards you an achievement accordingly. For Example: Achievement for undertaking 50 pushups. As our app is targeted at amateurs in the Workout field, it’s the little things like the achievement system that can help keep the average user interested in it for a long time.
