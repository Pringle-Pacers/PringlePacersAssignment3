                    Our group has a stable communication between members. We have two communication platforms, which consist of Microsoft Teams and Discord. Discord is mainly used as a notification; we use it to notify each member about different things such as meeting is starting or if someone is unable to attend meetings due to some unforeseen circumstances. We use Discord as everyone in our group is used to it, so the communication is consistent and reliable, everyone is also used to the notification sound, so we are more likely to receive a response on Discord than Teams. Discord is also used for us to notify each other when something comes up and they may not be able to attend meetings or do part of the work, which we can then replan our dates and works. Microsoft Teams is used as a platform where we host our meetings. Microsoft Teams is also an official tool that we are required to use to record all our meetings. We also use Microsoft Teams to record all our work in the file, this is so that we can keep track of each other’s work while also keeping the collaboration process easy to do. We have also added Trello to one of our boards so that we can have an additional way to keep track of our individual work and the group progress to see if we are on track of finishing our assignments. Usually we would have 2 – 3 meetings weekly, one is during the allocated tutorial class that we have. We would conduct a meeting at that time if we were told to or given time to. The second meeting would be later that day, which is on Monday, and another would usually be on Thursday night. The time that we conduct the meetings is usually at 7:30pm, if team members are not free on Monday or Thursday, we would move the meeting to a day where everyone is able to attend so that no one gets left out or misses out on crucial information. If our group member is unresponsive then we would try to tag them on Discord and Microsoft Teams so that they are more likely to get notified. If they still don’t respond or communicate with us, then we would have to find other ways to contact them. So far, we have gotten to this point, which demonstrates that our team members are very responsive, and our group has a reliable way to communicate. Overall, our group communications are consistent and reliable, we can always communicate with each other and rely on each other for help.
