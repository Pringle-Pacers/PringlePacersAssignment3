                  After discussing with everyone in the group we decided to switch over to python. Python will be the main programming language that we will be using to code and program this application. This is because most of our team members are most comfortable, using python as they have the most experience in that application. We will be using a python web-framework called Flask, as it is light-weight and is fairly beginner friendly. This is an important feature for our group as some of us had little to no experience, working on and coding and backend of an application. Hence, Flaskâ€™s easy to use and easy to understand syntax and concepts will help make our development stage last shorter and help us achieve the final product more efficiently. Along with Flask, we will also be utilising PostgreSQL, for all our data needs. A database is needed to store user information and their progress but also to store the names of workouts and classify them into difficulties and to express what part of the body is most likely to benefit from a workout. Furthermore, as Flask is a web-framework, we will also need to make use of HTML/CSS to build our frontend on the application. To help us reach the result faster we will also be using Bootstrap, which is a CSS framework. Bootstrap will help us achieve the structure that we envision is a more efficient way and will be very useful throughout the whole development stage. After our development stage has finished, we are also hosting our application on Heroku, which our group have decided would be the best option, as python, PostgreSQL and Heroku as a Tech Stack are popular and work well with each other.
