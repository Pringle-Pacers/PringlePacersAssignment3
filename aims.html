                <h3>Aim</h3>
                    The ultimate aim for our final product is to be beginner friendly and assist the individuals who want to start working out and exercising. We will fulfil the final aim we have set for ourselves, by avoiding slang and jargon that amateurs in the workout world will be unfamiliar with or cause them to feel baffled. Hence, we will use mostly simple English so our user base does not feel overwhelmed. Furthermore, having workouts that scale and range in difficulty, is a topic we are tackling. Having workouts of varying difficulties, ensures that users are alarmed by the workouts when they first sign up. Furthermore, it also means that as our users become familiar with the easy difficult workouts, they will be able to step into more complex workouts to challenge themselves. In Conclusion, keeping our application beginner friendly will motivate individuals to start working out and lead a healthier lifestyle.

                <div class="tech-content-section">
                <h3>Goal 1</h3>
                    <strong>“Help people lead a healthier lifestyle”</strong>
                    <br>
                    The primary goal of our project is to help people lead a healthier lifestyle. Currently there is a high rate of obesity and overweight, and with the advancement of technologies improving by the day and making our life more convenient, this would only result in a lazier lifestyle for the majority of the people around the world. Lazy and unhealthy lifestyles will lead to a higher death number, improving the lifestyle and adapting a healthier lifestyle means that you are more likely to live a long life. Exercising helps with keeping your body at peak performance, reducing potential sickness which can be painful, exercising also improves mental health so less people develop mental issues they workout. Our app aims to make people healthy so that they can enjoy their life to the fullest.

                <h3>Goal 2</h3>
                    <strong>“Keeping our users motivated and them keep working out”</strong>
                    <br>
                    The second goal of our project is to keep our users motivated to work out. There are some people in the world who are motivated to workout only in the first two week. If they want to have a healthy life and perfect body shape, they have to keep doing the workout. In our workout application, we provided a feature that allows users to achieve the workout task. The application will show the achievements for the user to complete, which is in the achievement page. The aim is to motivate users to keep tracking and doing their workout by achieving the tasks.

                <div class="tech-content-section">
                    <h3>Goal 3</h3>
                        <strong>“Do the heavy thinking for the user, so they can get straight into the action”</strong>
                        <br>
                        Our third goal of our project is to prevent the user from feeling overwhelmed from both the sophistry of using technology and on how to proceed in their exercise routine given the user does not have enough time to study or research the best way to proceed for themselves. This is accomplished by having succinct and simple modules that allow the user to choose what they want knowing it has been customised to fit according to their experience, this is shown where they can pick between 6 pre-set workout lists which each have difficulty scaling to ease the user through progress. It is also then reflected when the user seeks to have a randomised set of exercises in the exercise randomiser section as the computer does the work on the randomisation on the set criteria of the user. All if which aims to reduce the burden from the user so they can do what they have intended to do with this application.

                <div class="tech-content-section">
                    <h3>Goal 4</h3>
                        <strong>“Give the user control of what they would like to focus on”</strong>
                        <br>
                        Another primary goal of our project is to give the users the freedom to choose what they would like to focus on. When working out, individuals are at different strengths and at different levels and so we would like users to be able to choose a workout that suits their strengths and level. Our workout app allows users to choose a specific body part they would like to work out, and a list of randomised workouts is presented to them which the user can pick and choose from. If users were given workouts that they did not need, their time and effort would be wasted and so giving users the ability to choose will allow them to progress their fitness and to also make them feel comfortable in what they would like to do.

                <div class="tech-content-section">
                    <h3>Goal 5</h3>
                    <strong>“Help the user keep track of their progress, so they can clearly visualise how far they have come”</strong>
                    <br>
                    Our last primary goal of our project is to allow our users to keep track of their progress so they can clearly visualise how far they have progressed, this is done via multiple ways, the first one being the list of exercises, as you finish exercises and complete them off the list this will remove the item from the list allowing you to see that the items are getting smaller and smaller until you complete all items in the list.
                    Another way we provide the user with updates on their progress is the achievements page, this page allows for users to view any completed achievements they have completed and progress on them (future implementation – currently shows percentage of total achievements rather than each achievement). This allows the user to view how far they have gotten since the start of their training and using our application.
