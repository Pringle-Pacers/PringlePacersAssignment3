                <h3>1. Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</h3>
                    First I would like to give you a brief background about my profession. I have been with Ego Pharmaceutical for 14 years. 
                    I started as a senior system manager. Then I was promoted to the current position as the ICT operation Manager. My job is
                    to ensure thatthe corporate IT infrastructure and network is running with minimal disruption to support the production and 
                    the business. To achieve this objective I would like to rely on my team members who are specialised in different IT areas to 
                    manage them. I receive their reports and identify areas that need attention and improvement. I provide guidance, support and 
                    courage to build teamwork. I research new technology suitable for the business and manufacture and plan for the implementation
                    with minimal disruption.I also run my team meetings fortnightly and attend meetings as requested by other departments.

                <div class="tech-content-section">
                <h3>2. Please tell us about the industry you work in.</h3>
                    I work for a pharmaceutical company. The company manufactures dermatology products such as skin care products. Some of which are 
                    famous brands such as QV Face, illusion and derm-aid. This company is an Australian company that employs about 700 staff around 
                    the world. Each member of the company is proud of their work and proud to be an employee of the company. Likewise, this company 
                    looks after their staff well and contributes to their community with their ongoing ethics.

                <div class="tech-content-section">
                <h3>3. What other kinds of work do you have to do? </h3>
                    Apart from general activity that I have mentioned above, I also mentor my team members for self training as well as attending work 
                    related conferences. I do ICT budgeting, approve IT changes and requests, change implementation, appraising IT software and 
                    hardware, managing IT risk and IT securities, and sometimes coding for system integration.

                <h3>4. Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about it.</h3>
                    I interact with different people from my team members to my supervisor, other managers in the same or different departments and 
                    user engineers, contractors, vendors, consultants and so on, depending on the work requirements from time to time.

                <div class="tech-content-section">
                <h3>5. Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.</h3>
                    The interactions with other IT professionalsâ€¦ Of the most common ones I normally face within the same IT projects are: problem 
                    solving, product training evaluation, product specification, integration, sharing IT knowledge and so on. I also interact with 
                    IT professionals outside of the organisation. When I attend IT conferences to share knowledge or to explore new technology.

                <div class="tech-content-section">
                <h3>6. What about your interactions with clients or investors?</h3>
                    I do not interact with the investors directly. I sometimes interact with clients to cover the support desk team in case they are
                    overloaded. In such situations, I need to minimise the use of highly technical jargon to avoid confusion or misunderstanding.

                <div class="tech-content-section">
                <h3>7. What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</h3>
                    The aspect that I find where I spend most of my time, is actually managing the team to make sure they actually perform to their 
                    best to provide support to the business and the factory or manufacturer. To ensure that they might have adequate resources and 
                    support to perform and complete their task on the daily basis or on the set time for project targets.

                <div class="tech-content-section">
                <h3>8. Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging? </h3>
                    The aspects that I find most challenging is keeping your IT knowledge afresh,keeping IT documents updated and relevant and making
                    IT changes, ensuring these changes are implemented smoothly. 
                </div>
                
                <div class="tech-content-section">
                <h3>9. Can you share an example of the work you do that best defines the IT industry?</h3>
                    The best experience I can give you which defines the IT industry actually is in automating the business model for self ordering 
                    taking towards production. It requires a lot of intrinsic knowledge between each component of the system. You need to know how 
                    the user or the cell representative actually submits the order by collecting the order from the pharmacy and submitting it to 
                    the cloud database. Then from there is actually translating the data into a format understandable by the other systems and then 
                    reinjecting it into an on-premises business system called SAP. And it's entirely automated and it actually helps save the amount 
                    of labour that individual people involved in the system have to spend on. And it's far more accurate and more timely than the 
                    manual recording the cell order. This will help with the knowledge of IT and the IT system infrastructure.

                <h3>10. Finally, are there any thoughts you would like to give to university students graduating from IT courses?</h3>
                    To me, IT is the future. This discipline accelerates the growth of business, manufacturing, research, health, entertainment and 
                    in return releases humans from hard labour to have more time for doing interesting things such as more time with the family, which  
                    makes society better through living happier and more meaningful lives. So, do IT!
